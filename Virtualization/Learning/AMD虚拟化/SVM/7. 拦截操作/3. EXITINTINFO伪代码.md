当guest中delivery异常或中断时，处理器检查**异常拦截**，并在异常delivery期间**发生拦截**的情况下更新**EXITINTINFO**的值。 以下伪代码概述了处理器如何传递事件（异常或中断）E。

```cpp
if E is an exception and is intercepted: #VMEXIT(E)
E = (result of combining E with any prior events)
if (result was #DF and #DF is intercepted): #VMEXIT(#DF)
if (result was shutdown and shutdown is intercepted): #VMEXIT(#shutdown)
EXITINTINFO = E // Record the event the guest is delivering.
Attempt delivery of E through the IDT
Note that this may cause secondary exceptions
Once an exception has been successfully taken in the guest:
EXITINTINFO.V = 0 // Delivery succeeded; no #VMEXIT. Dispatch to first instruction of handler
```
